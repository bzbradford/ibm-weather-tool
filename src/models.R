# Pecan scab risk model --------------------------------------------------------
# https://www.mesonet.org/agriculture/horticulture/pecan/pecan-scab-advisor
# The Mesonet Pecan Scab Advisor is an online weather-based management tool that identifies times when the risk of pecan scab infection is high. It is seasonal and operates between March 1 and August 31. The advisory is based on the accumulation of “pecan scab hours” which are defined as one hour with relative humidity greater than or equal to 90% and temperatures greater than or equal to 70°F. The advisory calculates the number of pecan scab hours that have occurred for the growing season, the past 14 days, and forecasts estimates for the next 3 ½ days utilizing the North American Model (NAM) forecast. Spraying is recommended when 10 pecan scab hours have accumulated for highly susceptible varieties, and it has been either 30 days after March 1 or 5 to 14 days (user selected) from the last fungicide application. For moderately susceptible varieties, it is 20 pecan scab hours, and 30 scab hours for low susceptible varieties.
# Highly Susceptible Varieties (10 Scab Hours): Burkett, Desirable, Maramec, Pawnee, Peruque, Western, and Wichita.
# Moderately Susceptible Varieties (20 Scab Hours): Caddo, Choctaw, Colby, Creek, Giles, Kiowa, Mohawk, Nacono, Oconee, Stuart, and Zinner.
# Low Susceptibile Varieties (30 Scab Hours): Excel, Hark, Kanza, Lakota, Mount, and Osage.
