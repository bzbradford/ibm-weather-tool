## Researcher's Weather Data Tool

This app is designed to provide an easy interface to view and download hourly weather data for any point in the continental United States. Data is derived from a subscription to IBM's Environmental Intelligence Suite, with a spatial resolution of 1/24th decimal degree (approximately 3 km).

Hourly weather parameters include:

-   Air temperature
-   Dew point
-   Relative humidity
-   Precipitation and snow accumulation
-   Wind speed and direction
-   Atmospheric pressure

In addition to hourly weather, derived datasets are generated including:

-   Daily minimum, maximum, and average values for each parameter
-   Moving averages on a 7, 14, 21, and 30-day basis
-   Model predictions for certain field and vegetable crop diseases
-   Daily and cumulative growing degree day calculations for common models

These data can be retrieved for individual locations, or multiple locations can be specified for batch downloading and comparison.
