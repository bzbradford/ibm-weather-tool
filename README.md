## Crop Risk and Weather Forecasting Tool

This app is designed as a decision support tool featuring plant disease and growth models and insect phenology models, with a focus on providing model outputs and color-coded risk or action interpretations. Users may also directly view and download the underlying hourly weather data, or daily/moving average/growing degree-day data derived from it. All historical and 16-day hourly forecast data is sourced from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), with a spatial resolution of ~9 km. Open-Meteo is backended by the [ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/changes-ecmwf-model), which provides global coverage.

### How to use the app

1.  **Define one or more sites of interest.** Sites can be added by uploading a CSV from the sidebar, by clicking on the map, by searching for a place name in the search bar at the lower left of the map, or by entering GPS coordinates in the search bar at the lower right of the map. Your site list can be saved to a CSV, but it is also saved in a browser cookie and restored when revisiting the app, unless the cookie has been deleted.
2.  **View crop risk model results.** Use the "Crop risk models" tab to select a crop and risk model to display in the charts feed and on the map.
3.  **Explore weather data.** Use the "Charts and data" tab to explore hourly, daily, and other derived weather variables on a chart. This weather data can also be downloaded from this tab.

### Crop risk models

Selected field crops and vegetable disease model outputs are provided. These models are subject to change. The calculations used to generate each model prediction can be viewed in the source code.

- **Field crops models**
  - Corn: Tar spot, Gray leaf spot, Gibberella/DON
  - Soybean: White mold, Frogeye leaf spot, Cercospora (beta)
  - Wheat: Wheat scab
  - Cotton: Cotton planting risk
- **Vegetable crop diseases**
  - Potato/tomato: Early blight, late blight
  - Carrot: Alternaria and Cercospora leaf blights
  - Beet: Cercospora leaf spot
  - Onion: Botrytis leaf blight
- **Cover crops**
  - Winter rye biomass
- **Tree crops**
  - Pecan scab
- **Insects**
  - Seedcorn maggot
  - Alfalfa weevil
  - Colorado potato beetle

### Data and methods

Hourly weather measures include:

- Air temperature
- Dew point
- Relative humidity
- Precipitation (rain + snowfall)
- Snowfall and snow depth
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure
- Soil temperature and moisture

In addition to hourly weather, derived datasets are generated including:

- Daily minimum, maximum, and average values for each parameter
- Moving averages on a 7, 14, 21, and 30-day basis
- Daily and cumulative growing degree day calculations for common models
- Model predictions for certain field and vegetable crop diseases

These data can be retrieved for individual locations, or multiple locations can be specified for batch downloading and comparison.

#### Hourly data

Hourly data includes the timestamp in UTC and an adjustment to local time based on the timezone associated with the GPS coordinates. Hourly weather parameters include air temperature, dew point, dew point depression (difference between air temperature and dew point), relative humidity, precipitation, snow accumulation, wind speed, wind gusts, wind direction, barometric pressure (mean sea level), and pressure change since the previous hour.

Note: A wind gust is defined as a brief increase in wind speed that is at least 10 mph (16 km/h) faster than the average wind speed and peaks above 18 mph (30 km/h). Due to these definitions not every hour or day will have recorded wind gusts.

#### Weather forecast

When the End Date is set to today's date, 14-day forecasts are retrieved from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and incorporated into charts and model calculations. Open Meteo sources weather forecasts from multiple governmental sources to ensure broad coverage.

#### Daily data

For each hourly weather parameter, the minimum, mean, and maximum value are generated. In addition, the total daily value is generated when appropriate (precipitation and snow accumulation).

#### Moving averages

7, 14, 21, and 30-day moving averages are calculated for each daily value. Either centered or right-aligned (trailing) moving average types are available.

#### Growing degree days

The single sine method is used to calculate growing degree days from daily minimum and maximum air temperature values. For each base temperature, a model is provided with and without the common 86°F upper threshold temperature (horizontal cutoff). The single sine method differs from the simple average method only when the minimum temperature is below the lower threshold temperature, or the maximum temperature is above the upper threshold temperature. In such cases, the single sine method will more accurately reflect the amount of heat energy available, relative to the simple average method.

#### Units

Most values can be shown in either imperial or metric units.

- Temperature and dew point: °C or °F
- Relative humidity and soil moisture: %
- Precipitation (rain/melted snowfall) and evapotranspiration: mm or in
- Snowfall: cm or in
- Snow depth: m or ft
- Atmospheric pressure: kPa or inHg
- Wind speed and gust: km/h or mph
- Wind direction: compass degrees (N=0°, E=90°, etc.)
- Growing degree day base/upper thresholds and accumulations are always in Fahrenheit Degree Days. Conversion to Celsius Degree Days may be accomplished by dividing by 1.8.

#### Cropland data layer

Optionally, the [Cropland Data Layer](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php) (CDL) can be shown as an overlay on the map by expanding the layers control in the upper right of the map and enabling a CDL overlay. This map is generated annually from satellite observations and represents the best estimate of the land cover class (eg water, forest, cultivated crop) grown at each pixel location. Dataset resolution has been 30 meters until 2024 when it increased to 10 meters. [Click here](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/sarsfaqs2.php) for frequently asked questions about the CDL. [Click here](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/docs/US_2024_CDL_legend.jpg) for a legend showing the display color used for each crop. Non-crop landcover is intuitively colored (eg forest is green, grass/shrubland is lighter green, water is blue, urban is grey). Crop colors vary but corn is yellow, soybean is green, potato is maroon. The CDL may also be explored on official websites such as [CroplandCROS](https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/) and [Cropscape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/).
